This project is a small Android app that captures live camera video, processes each frame using OpenCV (C++) through JNI, and shows the result in real time using OpenGL ES 2.0.
It also includes a small web viewer made with TypeScript, which displays a sample processed image and basic frame details like FPS and resolution.
